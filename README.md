# GoogleImageSearch
Swift implementation of (old) Google Image Search API

![](https://github.com/entaq/GoogleImageSearch/blob/master/search_demo.gif)
## Features
* [UICollectionViewController](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UICollectionViewController_clas/index.html) with a Flow Layout in Swift
* Search field in the Navigation Bar 
* Auto fetches the next page as you scroll
* Uses the [Google Image Search API](https://developers.google.com/image-search/). This is deprecated but this pattern should work with [Instagram API](https://instagram.com/developer/endpoints/media/) or [Flickr API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.search.html) as well
* (PENDING) Tests in [Quick](https://github.com/Quick/Quick) with [Nimble](https://github.com/Quick/Nimble) assertions to validate app behavior
